# twitter-and-us-lawmakers

## Project overview

A collection of Twitter + US Lawmaker resources. 

1. [Twitter handles for US lawmakers](https://github.com/jaytimm/twitter-and-us-lawmakers/blob/master/twitter-handles.md) from congresses 115 & 116; including chamber, congress, and bioguide-id;

2. Tweet corpus + Tweet IDs: all tweets generated from all US lawmakers during congresses 115 & 116.; and

3. [A flex-dashboard application](https://github.com/jaytimm/twitter-and-us-lawmakers/blob/master/flex-dash.md) for searching a corpus of tweets for lexical patterns in context.  


## General thoughts

The goal of this project is super simple: to have a congressional corpus of tweets -- updated daily -- that can be easily searched, and easily linked (via lawmaker) to other types of political data, eg, election returns, political ideologies, census data/geographies, etc.  This is ultimately a non-trivial task, for any number of reasons, and documented here.

The resources collated here have been aggregated from two fantastic & ongoing projects.  

1. The [GWU Libraries Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/gwu-libraries), which makes available tweets/handles ..., including the last two US congresses.  https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/

2. The [Tweets of Congress](https://github.com/alexlitel/congresstweets) project.

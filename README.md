# twitter-and-us-lawmakers

## Project overview

A collection of Twitter + US Lawmaker resources: 

1. [Twitter handles for US lawmakers](https://github.com/jaytimm/twitter-and-us-lawmakers/blob/master/twitter-handles.md) from congresses 115 & 116; including chamber, congress, and bioguide-id;

2. [Tweet corpus]() and [Tweet IDs](): (most) tweets generated by (most) US lawmakers during congresses 115 & 116.; and

3. [A flex-dashboard application](https://)github.com/jaytimm/twitter-and-us-lawmakers/blob/master/flex-dash.md) for searching a corpus of tweets for lexical patterns in context.  

**The goal of this project is super simple**: to have a congressional corpus of tweets -- updated daily -- that can be easily searched, and easily linked (via lawmaker identifier) to other types of political data, eg, election returns, political ideologies, census data/geographies, etc.

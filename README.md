2. Tweet corpus + Tweet IDs; and

3. [Flex-dashboard application for context-based corpus search](https://github.com/jaytimm/twitter-and-us-lawmakers/blob/master/flex-dash.md).


## Overview

A set of Twitter handles for US lawmakers from congresses 115 & 116; including chamber, congress, and bioguide_id.  All tweets generated from all US lawmakers during congresses 115 & 116.  A Shiny/flexdashboard for searching a corpus of tweets for lexical patterns in context.  


## General thoughts

The goal of this project is super simple: to have a congressional corpus of tweets -- updated daily -- that can be easily searched, and easily linked (via lawmaker) to other types of political data, eg, election returns, political ideologies, census data, etc.  This is ultimately a non-trivial task, for any number of reasons, and documented here.

The resources collated here have been aggregated from two fantastic & ongoing projects.

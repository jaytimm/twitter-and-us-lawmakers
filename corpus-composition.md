Collecting all tweets generated by all lawmakers from congresses 115 &
116 (3 January 2017 to present day) in one fell swoop is not possible
via the Twitter API. Instead, the best way to build such a corpus would
have been to scrape tweets daily or weekly for congress members starting
at 3 January 2017.

While this ship has sailed for me, other/smarter folks have been doing
this – eg – [the George Washington University (GWU)
Library](https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/). GWU makes available Tweet
IDs for this set of tweets, and [DocNow’s
Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) can then be used to obtain
actual tweet data based on the Tweet ID.

Corpus composition
------------------

[Tweets of Congress](https://github.com/alexlitel/congresstweets) make
available tweets generated by US lawmakers … updated daily. The problem
is that the collection only includes tweets from June 2017 onward. So,
tweets from the first half of the first session of the 115th congress
are not included.

The GWU data set … only includes tweets up until May 2020. Presumably
these will be updated at some point …

But we want to construct a real-time corpus, and …

**Resolution**. We use the GWU *tweet-set* for congress 115 and for
congress 116 up until 5/2020, where GWU stops –

So, we update our tweet-set via `rtweet` using the *same twitter-handles
that seed GWU tweet-set* –
